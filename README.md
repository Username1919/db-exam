# Community Building
This app provides a useful starting point for building your own web app using both SocketIO
and Firebase.
 
SocketIO is a lean JavaScript library for lightning fast realtime communication.

Firebase is Google's cloud backend as a service. Firebase provides many individual services
including Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, and more. 

This starter project implements [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to provide user login with Google Auth and to read and write to the database.

The Google Auth sign in gives your app a defined userbase from which you can start to build a community.
